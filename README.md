 ## Description
For week 18 our student challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I had to use Express.js for routing, MongoDB and Moongoose. The criteria we had to meet were as follows 
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

 ## Installation
  Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself. After installing please open the root directory of the repo, click open terminal, and run the command.
```
npm i
```
And after you can run this command to start the application. 
```
node index
```
 ## Usage
The main usage of this challenge was to demonstrate my ability to utilize all my resources and knowledge to take make an application back end that would be able to allow users to interact with each other. This is a smaller less complex version of how bigger websites like facebook and instagram would have it. Learning this allows us to expand what we are capable of creating.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I used the student mini project for week 18 to help give me a sense of direction on where to start. I also used some of the functions provided by it as well.<br />
 I would also like to credit the module itself as it helped me set up the models and showing me the exact things required for each model.<br />
 Finally I would like to thank my classmate Justin Feagin for helping me with debugging my controllers when I was stuck.

 ## Testing
To test my application, you must first download my code from my github, and launch it using your preffered coding application. Open the terminal of the root directory and run the command npm i to install all dependencies. You will then run the command node index to start the application in your local host, and simply launch insomnia and set up the routes to test out the application for yourself.
